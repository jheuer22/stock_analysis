# Stock Analysis Using Refactored VBA Code

## Overview of Project: 
In this analysis we refactored an existing VBA code that was created to evaluate the performance of a set of stocks over the course of 2017 and 2018. We refactored this code in order to make it more efficient. 


## Results: 
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

In this VBA code, we were analyzing the performance of 12 stocks during 2017 and 2018. The original code was written with For Loops to loop through all of the stocks and create an output table that showed the Total Daily Volume for each stock as well as the return rate for the year. /assets/images/electrocat.png
